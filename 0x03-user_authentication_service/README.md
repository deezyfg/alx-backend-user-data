0x03. User authentication service
===================================

> Back-end | Authentification

This project uses Python and Flask to implement a robust user authentication service from scratch. It covers creating a secure user management system, including user registration, login functionality, session handling, and password reset mechanisms. The project emphasizes best practices in authentication, such as password hashing, secure token generation, and proper database interactions. By building this service, developers will gain hands-on experience with crucial backend security concepts and learn to create a robust authentication system that can serve as a foundation for more complex web applications.
